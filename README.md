Sphire Hydra is a Go library designed to dynamically hydrate Go structs with data from a variety of databases.
The library supports multiple databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, 
Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, MariaDB, and CockroachDB. Using reflection and `hydra` tags, 
it automatically fills struct fields with data fetched from database queries.

> [!WARNING]  
> Hydra went from idea to fruition in the span of 4 hours. It is still a very immature project, use it at your own risk. I welcome all opinions, contributions, and ideas on how to make this a better project. 

## Features

- **Automatic Hydration**: Automatically populates Go structs with data fetched from databases using reflection.
- **Multiple Database Support**: Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, MariaDB, and CockroachDB.
- **Flexible Queries**: Allows dynamic construction of SQL `WHERE` clauses.
- **Type Safety**: Ensures proper type conversions between database values and Go struct fields.
- **Easily Extendable**: Easily extendable to support more databases in the future.

## Installation

To install Sphire Hydra, use `go get`:

```bash
go get github.com/sphireinc/Hydra
```

## Supported Databases

- MySQL 
- PostgreSQL 
- SQLite
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Oracle
- MariaDB
- CockroachDB

## Usage

### Struct Definition

Define your structs with hydra tags to map the struct fields to the corresponding database columns, annd 
embed the hydra.Hydratable struct:

```go
type Person struct {
    Name        string `json:"name" hydra:"name"`
    Age         int    `json:"age" hydra:"age"`
    Email       string `json:"email" hydra:"email"`
    hydra.Hydratable
}
```

### Hydration

To hydrate a struct, initialize the struct and then call the Hydrate method, which automatically fetches the
data from the database and populates the fields:

```go
package main

import (
    "database/sql"
    "github.com/sphireinc/Hydra"
    _ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
)

type Person struct {
    Name        string `json:"name" hydra:"name"`
    Age         int    `json:"age" hydra:"age"`
    Email       string `json:"email" hydra:"email"`
    hydra.Hydratable
}

func createDBConnection() *sql.DB {
	db, _ := sql.Open("mysql", "user:password@/dbname")
	return db
}

func main() {
	// Create a database connection
	db := createDBConnection() 

	// Create an addressable Person instance and initialize the hydra.Hydratable struct
    p := &Person{} 
    p.Init(p)

	// Create a map of where clauses
	whereClause := map[string]interface{}{"id": "U6"} 

    // Call Hydrate to populate the struct with data from the database
    p.Hydrate(db, whereClause)

    // Print the hydrated struct
    fmt.Printf("Hydrated person: %+v\n", p)
}
```

# Extensibility

Sphire Hydra is designed to be easily extensible. You can add support for additional databases by implementing a 
fetch function specific to the databaseâ€™s query syntax and integrating it with the existing hydration process.
