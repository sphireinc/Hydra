# Conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
all regardless of religion, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability,
or other personal characteristic.

Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or
implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom
a right answer, merely an optimal answer given a set of values and
circumstances.

Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you
want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.

We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone.

Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel
you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community
member, please contact the core team immediately. Whether you're a regular
contributor or a newcomer, we care about you, and we've got your back.

Likewise, any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing
behaviour is not welcome.

# Communication

GitHub Issues are the primary way for communicating about specific proposed
changes to this project.

Please follow the conduct guidelines above. Language issues are often contentious,
and we'd like to keep discussion brief, civil and focused on what we're actually
doing, not wandering off into too much imaginary stuff.
